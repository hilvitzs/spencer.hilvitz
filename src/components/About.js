        <p>I have spent my life trying to find a way to combine my love of art and logic. Art gives us a space to explore life and find new ways to solve age old problems. Logic is what allows us to apply those newfound solutions to the real world in its most useful context. Coding is something that combines and pushes those two ideas to their limits. I love new technologies and finding real world applications for those new technologies. I love bettering user experience and creating meaningful applications that will make the world a better place. Most of all, I love the opportunities that technology gives humanity to create a better life for everyone. I hope to find a career that continues my growth in both creativity and logic, while maintaining and increasing the quality of life for everyone who uses my creations.</p>
